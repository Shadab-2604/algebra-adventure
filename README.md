## 🛠 How to Run Locally  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shadab-2604/maths-adventure.git
   cd maths-adventure
````

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click), or use a local server:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

   then visit `http://localhost:8000`

---

## 🧩 How It Works (Overview)

* Each math topic (Algebra, LCM, HCF) has its own HTML page (e.g. `algebra.html`)
* The home page links to these topics
* Inside each topic page:

  * **Learn** mode displays sequential lessons (stored in a JS array)
  * **Practice** mode generates random equations and options
  * **Test** mode runs timed quizzes
  * Feedback, scoring, animations, and UI state are managed via vanilla JS

---

## 🛠 Customization & Extension

You can easily extend or adapt this project:

* Add new lessons: increase the `lessons` array
* Tweak difficulty: change ranges in `generateEquation()`
* Adjust number of practice / test questions
* Replace emoji visuals with images or SVGs
* Add new topics: duplicate the structure (learn, practice, test)
* Store performance data in **localStorage** for progress tracking
* Add accessibility improvements: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels

---

## ✅ Browser Support

Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

---

## ♿ Accessibility & Future Enhancements

* Keyboard support (arrow keys, Enter)
* ARIA labels and screen reader compatibility
* Dark mode or theme toggle
* User profiles and progress persistence
* More topics and deeper levels
* Leaderboards, challenges, or multiplayer modes
