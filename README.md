## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shadab-2604/algebra-adventure.git
   cd algebra-adventure
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Serve with a static server (optional):
     ```bash
     # using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     # then open http://localhost:8000
     ```

## üß© How It Works (Brief)

- Lessons are defined in a `lessons` array inside the file ‚Äî each lesson contains `title` and `html`.
- Practice and Test modes generate equations randomly (add/subtract/multiply/divide) and produce 4 answer options.
- Scoring, timers and UI state are managed by vanilla JS functions inside `index.html`.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Customize

- Add or edit lessons: modify the `lessons` array.
- Change difficulty: tweak random ranges in `generateEquation()` (inside the script).
- Adjust the number of practice/test questions by editing `maxPracticeQuestions` / `maxTestQuestions`.
- Replace emoji visuals with images or SVGs if desired.

---

## ‚úÖ Browser Compatibility

Tested on modern browsers. Works offline as it is a static file.

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility & Improvements (Ideas)

- Add keyboard navigation for options (Left/Right/Enter).
- Provide ARIA labels for screen readers.
- Add localized text (translations) for other languages.
- Add levels and user profiles / persistent scores (localStorage).
